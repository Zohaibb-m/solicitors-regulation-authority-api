        <p>
          BriefBase helps members of the public set out their legal situation clearly, then connects them with law firms based on location and specialism. We produce a <strong>BriefBase, solicitor-ready brief</strong> to ensure you receive a clear and structured overview from the outset.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our aim is to make client onboarding as seamless as possible,  saving you time whilst helping the client move forward with confidence. The client is seeking professional support.
        </p>
        <p>
         There's no obligation to respond. If the matter isn't suitable or your firm is unavailable, you don't need to take any action. If you are able to assist, a direct reply to the client would be appreciated and helps us ensure they receive timely support.
