          Hi <strong>{client_name}</strong>,
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you again for trusting <strong>BriefBase</strong> to bring clarity to your situation. We hope the guidance was smooth and helpful to you in moving forwards.
        </p>

        <p>
          As promised, we've attached your structured brief. This is a clear, solicitor-ready summary of your details. You can print it out and take it to a solicitor in person, or simply forward the PDF Brief to them. Whichever works best for you.
        </p>
